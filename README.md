## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. This project analyzes tweets to understand public sentiment on various topics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of tweets collected from Twitter. Each tweet is labeled with a sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.

## Model
The sentiment analysis model is built using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or deep learning models like LSTM. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of tweets.

## Results
The results of the sentiment analysis are saved in a CSV file with the predicted sentiment for each tweet. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
